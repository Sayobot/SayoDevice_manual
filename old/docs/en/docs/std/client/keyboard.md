Note: (If you donâ€™t understand, please ignore this article) After sending the modifier key, it will automatically delay 10ms before sending the general key. This is because some software (for example: remote desktop) will not recognize keys pressed simultaneously as shortcut keys. , must be done in sequence; there will be no delay if you only set a single key.
