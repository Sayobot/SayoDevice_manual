# Touch Sensitivity Configuration

The touch sensitivity feature is available on specific SayoDevice models equipped with touch-sensitive surfaces. This functionality allows you to fine-tune how your device responds to touch inputs for optimal performance.

## Understanding Touch Sensitivity

Touch sensitivity determines:
- How quickly the device registers a touch input
- The amount of pressure required to register a touch
- The responsiveness to rapid or light touches

Proper calibration ensures your device responds precisely to your touch style, neither triggering accidentally nor requiring excessive force.

## Adjusting Touch Sensitivity

You can customize the touch sensitivity through two methods:

### Method 1: Using the Slider

1. Navigate to the Touch Settings section in the application
2. Locate the sensitivity adjustment slider
3. Drag the slider left (less sensitive) or right (more sensitive)
4. Test the new sensitivity setting directly on your device
5. Fine-tune as needed until you achieve the desired response

### Method 2: Using the Value Box

1. Navigate to the Touch Settings section
2. Find the numerical value box to the right of the slider
3. Enter a specific sensitivity value:
   - Lower values (5-30): Less sensitive, requires firmer touch
   - Middle values (31-70): Balanced sensitivity for most users
   - Higher values (71-100): More sensitive, responds to lighter touch
4. Press Enter to apply the new setting
5. Test and adjust as needed

## Recommended Settings for Different Uses

### For Typing and Productivity
- **Recommended range**: 40-60
- Provides good balance between responsiveness and accidental touch prevention
- Reduces fatigue during long typing sessions

### For Gaming
- **Recommended range**: 60-80
- Offers faster response times
- Better for rapid, repeated activations

### For Precision Work
- **Recommended range**: 30-50
- Helps prevent accidental activations
- Provides more control for deliberate inputs

## Troubleshooting Touch Response Issues

### If Touch is Too Sensitive
- Decrease sensitivity (move slider left or reduce value)
- Ensure your hands are dry
- Check for interference from nearby electronic devices

### If Touch is Not Responsive Enough
- Increase sensitivity (move slider right or increase value)
- Ensure the touch surface is clean
- Make sure firmware is up to date
- Verify proper USB connection

### If Touch Response is Inconsistent
- Try resetting to default sensitivity (value 50)
- Check for firmware updates
- Ensure device is properly connected
- Clean the touch surface with appropriate materials

## Care and Maintenance

For optimal touch performance:
- Keep touch surfaces clean and free of oils and debris
- Avoid using with wet hands or in extremely humid environments
- Periodically recalibrate sensitivity as your usage patterns change
