# Script Recording

The script recording feature allows you to create sophisticated macros by capturing your keyboard and mouse actions in real-time. This is often easier than programming scripts manually, especially for complex sequences.

## Recording Requirements

Before recording a script, ensure:

1. Your device has the appropriate functions enabled in Option Byte settings:
   - For keyboard recording: No special requirements
   - For mouse recording: Enable "Relative Mouse" or "Absolute Mouse" function
   - For multimedia keys: Enable "Multimedia Control" function

2. Your device is properly connected via USB (recommended for the most reliable recording)

3. You have sufficient space for new scripts (check available script slots)

## Recording Process

### Starting a Recording

1. Navigate to the Script tab in the application
2. Click the "Record" button in the toolbar
3. A recording control panel will appear
4. Give your script a descriptive name
5. Click "Start Recording" when ready

### During Recording

While recording is active:

- A small indicator appears in the corner of your screen
- All supported key presses and mouse actions are captured
- You can pause recording by pressing the designated hotkey (default: F12)
- The recording panel shows the current status and duration

### Stopping the Recording

To finish recording:

1. Click "Stop Recording" in the control panel, or
2. Press the designated stop hotkey (default: F12 twice)
3. Review the recorded script in the script editor

## Editing Recorded Scripts

After recording, you can refine your script:

1. Adjust timing by modifying delay values
2. Remove unwanted actions
3. Add conditions or loops for more advanced functionality
4. Test and verify the script works as expected

## Recording Tips for Best Results

### Keyboard Recording Tips

- Type at a moderate pace for accurate timing
- Include deliberate pauses where needed
- Keep combinations (like Ctrl+C) pressed slightly longer than normal

### Mouse Recording Tips

- Move the mouse smoothly and deliberately
- For precise positioning, move slowly
- Use clear, distinct clicks rather than rapid clicking

### General Recording Recommendations

- Record in a clean environment without unnecessary applications open
- Practice the sequence before recording to avoid mistakes
- Keep recordings focused on specific tasks (create multiple scripts for complex workflows)
- Add appropriate comments after recording to document the script's purpose

## Troubleshooting Recording Issues

**If actions aren't being recorded:**
- Verify your device has the necessary functions enabled
- Ensure the application has proper permissions
- Try reconnecting your device

**If timing seems off:**
- Edit the delay values between actions
- Consider recording at a slower pace
- Add additional delays in sections requiring precise timing

**If the script doesn't play back correctly:**
- Check for environment-specific dependencies (screen resolution, application state)
- Verify all required applications are open during playback
- Add conditional checks for more robust operation
