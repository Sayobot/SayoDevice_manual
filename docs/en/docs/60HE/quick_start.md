## Assembly  

### Self-Assembly (No tutorial available temporarily)  

## Key Testing  

After installing the switches, power on the device. Wait 2 seconds, then test if keys respond when pressed.  

## Lighting Test  

Press the shortcut key (**FN+T**) to enter the lighting test.  
Lights will illuminate in red, green, blue, and white sequentially.  
Press any key to continue testing.  

## Key Calibration  

- Calibrate keys only after full assembly.  
- RT features require calibration first!  
- Uncalibrated keys will simulate a mechanical switch.  
- Calibrate via the web interface or shortcut keys.  
- Calibration shortcut: **ESC+R+Right Arrow **:  
  ESC+R+Right Arrow (64/66-key models)  
  ESC+R+FN (61-key model)  
  Hold for 3+ seconds to enter calibration mode. Follow the LED prompts to press highlighted keys.  
- Recalibrate after switch replacement or disassembly.
