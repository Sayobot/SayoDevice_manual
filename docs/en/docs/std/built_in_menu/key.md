**RT Top** The upper deadzone for RT. Set this to the bottom of the key travel to disable RT (**default: 1.5mm**).  
**RT End** The lower deadzone for RT. Set this to the top of the key travel to disable RT (**default: 3.85mm**).  
**RT Trigger** Distance to trigger within the RT zone (**default: 0.2mm**).  
**RT Release** Distance to release within the RT zone (**default: 0.4mm**).
