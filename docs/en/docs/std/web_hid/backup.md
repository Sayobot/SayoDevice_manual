# Backup and Restore

## Overview
The backup feature allows you to save your device configuration settings to your computer. This is useful for:

- Transferring settings to a new or different device
- Sharing your configuration with other users
- Restoring settings after a firmware update

## Creating a Backup

1. Navigate to the Backup section in the application
2. Click the **Export** button
3. Choose a location on your computer to save the backup file
4. Give the file a descriptive name (e.g., "SayoDevice_Keyboard_Backup_March2025")

## Restoring from a Backup

1. Navigate to the Backup section in the application
2. Click the **Import** button
3. Browse to the location of your backup file
4. Select the file and click **Open**
5. Confirm the restoration when prompted

## Important Notes

- Always create a backup before updating firmware or making major configuration changes
- Backup files are compatible with devices of the same model
