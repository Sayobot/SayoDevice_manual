# Script Recording

## Web Recording Feature

The web-based script recording feature is currently under development. In the meantime, you can use the desktop version to record scripts.

## Using the Desktop Version for Recording

1. Download the desktop application from the link in the top-right corner of the web interface
2. Install and launch the desktop application
3. Connect your SayoDevice to your computer
4. Navigate to the Script section in the application
5. Click the **Record** button to start recording your actions
6. Perform the key presses, mouse movements, or other actions you want to record
7. Click **Stop** when finished
8. Save your recorded script

## Best Practices for Script Recording

- Keep recordings short and focused on specific tasks
- Allow brief pauses between actions for reliable playback
- Test your recorded scripts to ensure they work as expected
- Add appropriate delays between actions if needed
- Consider editing the script after recording to optimize timing

## Importing Scripts to Web Interface

Once you've created scripts in the desktop application, you can:
1. Export them from the desktop application
2. Import them into the web interface when this feature becomes available
